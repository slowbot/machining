Machining
=========

Machining is a method of front end development preferred by the team at Mister Machine. It involves rolling togeher design and development practices.  

Getting Started
-------

* **Sketching**
Raster Templates. We still use Photoshop. Raster based desktop aplications are very good at specific operations that allow for free asscoaition and of art direction. 

* **Typecast**
We encourage the use of Typecast to experiment with font families, sizing and type scale.

* **Gridlovers**
We also suggest moving onto Gridlover for layout rules. Once we extract some key numbers extracted from Typecast we  experiment with vertical rhytmns and breakpoints. 

Setting up a Project
-------

### Software of Choice
* Github for Mac
* Sublime

### Molecule Man
* Sass w/Compass
* Style Tile - Update (Tiling)
* Type
* Color
* Grid & Rhythm
* Globals

Parts Inventory
-------

### Content Audit 
### Sitemap & Wireframes

### Define content building blocks (Blocking)
* News site - single article
* Reality site - single property
* Define larger groupings of related content
* Archive, Search
* Map global elements
* Header, Footer

### Namespacing (Scribing)
* Domain language will be shared across Product, Design and Development
* Use minimal descriptive naming to organize your style into modules
* Nest required classes within a Component class to avoid collision
* Build more specific names using dashes or &-
* Avoid dashing more than 3 levels deep

Pattern Library
-------

### Base Unit Process (Looming)
* Font size ex. 16px
* Character Measure per line ex. 65
* Vertical Line height based on legibility ex. 1.5
* Base Units in both directions (16 x 1.5 = 24px)
* Columns and Gutters ex. 12/24/36/48px

### Workflow (Tooling)
*  Start with a low resolution HTML site map within the static environment
* Focus on key wireframes to extract new Partials
* Avoid using grid classes on the Partial level to ensure reuse
* Reserve Component definitions to include only high level site content

### Interactions (Prototyping)
* Include external js files and add function calls to app.js with commenting
* Create a new partial to sandbox interaction styles
